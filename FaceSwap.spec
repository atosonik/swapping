# and pip, and PyInstaller's isolated analysis subprocess crashes importing
# onnx.reference.
# matplotlib is NOT excludable, however unused it looks: insightface/app/__init__
# imports mask_renderer -> thirdparty.face3d.mesh.vis -> matplotlib, at import
# time and unconditionally. Dropping it builds fine and then dies at first use
# with ModuleNotFoundError. Costs ~40 MB in the bundle.

# PyQt5 and scikit-learn each ship their own copy of the MSVC redistributable
# under the SAME filename (590 KB vs 643 KB). PyInstaller flattens every binary
# into one folder, so one silently wins -- and if PyQt5's wins, onnxruntime's
# pybind11 extension fails with "DLL load failed ... initialization routine
# failed" no matter what order things are imported in. Dropping all of them makes
# the process bind to the system runtime in C:\Windows\System32, which is the
# same runtime onnxruntime binds to successfully outside PyInstaller.
#
# Requires the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable on the target
# machine. Windows 10/11 normally has it; onnxruntime requires it regardless.
